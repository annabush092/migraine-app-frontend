# migraine-app-frontend

Front-end:
Several page app:
- Login screen- once logged in, they should stay logged in for easy access
- Homescreen: A simple mobile page with buttons for each trigger they have on their list. When you press a button, it means you've had that trigger. Also have a NavBar/Logo that users click when they are experiencing a migraine, to log when it starts.
- Add trigger page: A page where you add a trigger that you want displayed on your homescreen so you can log when you have it. This has several types of triggers, the one-time-only (like having a glass of wine) and the time-duration triggers (like how long you sleep each night)
- Stats page: A page that links to different stats - when the user had certain triggers, when they've had headaches (on a calendar or graph), how many headaches they've had in the past week/month/year, headache details, most likely triggers, etc. This could just be one big display, or a menu to see different stats (maybe use Runkeeper stats ux as inspiration)
- Some sort of page to rate headaches after they happen, to provide duration (start and end time) and severity. An edit page for headaches. Think google survey for this page- simple and fast.


Add Bootstrap for formatting
